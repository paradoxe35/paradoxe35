### 👋
Hello there! My name is Paradoxe Ngwasi, and I'm passionate about automating stuff and exploring low-level computer concepts. I thrive on the challenge of creating efficient and reliable systems through programming.

🚀 Here are my favorite programming languages:
---------------------------------------------

- **Golang:** I love using Go for developing system tools, command-line interfaces (CLIs), and high-performance applications.

- **Elixir:** Elixir is another language I enjoy working with. Its powerful concurrency model and fault-tolerant features make it great for building distributed and scalable applications.

- **Typescript:** I have extensive experience with Typescript, particularly in web development. It's my go-to language for building robust and maintainable frontend and backend applications.

- **Rust:** 🌱 I'm currently expanding my knowledge by learning Rust. Its focus on memory safety and performance makes it ideal for systems programming.

- **PHP:** While I have been using PHP for a while, my recent focus has shifted to other languages. However, I still have a strong foundation in PHP, especially for web development projects.

Experience
----------

💻 I have practical experience using Typescript and PHP for web development projects. I've worked on creating dynamic and user-friendly websites and web applications, leveraging the power of these languages and their respective frameworks.

🔧 Additionally, I have utilized Golang extensively for system tools and command-line utilities. I appreciate Go's simplicity, concurrency model, and efficient execution speed, which make it a valuable language for various tasks.

DevOps and Infrastructure Automation
------------------------------------

🛠️ I am also interested in the DevOps philosophy and have been using DevOps tools for the past two years to automate infrastructure provisioning and deployment. Thanks to technologies like Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Ansible, Packer, and more, I have gained experience in streamlining and orchestrating the deployment process.

Philosophy and Interests
------------------------

🌟 I embrace adventure and enjoy exploring new technologies and concepts. I firmly believe that constantly testing new things and challenging ourselves is the key to personal and professional growth. To me, this is what distinguishes a junior developer from a senior one.

🤝 Collaboration is important to me, and I always strive to work effectively with others. I am open to new opportunities where I can contribute my skills, learn from others, and make a positive impact on projects.

Slogan
------

✨ "I believe in moving at a sustainable pace and fixing what's broken." This philosophy drives my approach to development. I value quality, maintainability, and addressing issues head-on to create robust and reliable solutions.

> Let's collaborate, innovate, and make a difference together!
